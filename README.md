`time-lord` is a gem that gives you more human like expressions for time and space math.
Underneath the covers `time-lord` gives you single purpose objects for handling the more complex parts of Time & Space.
Specifically conversion, periods between two points, and scaling.


Examples
--------

In `time-lord` you have Period objects:

``` ruby
1.hour.ago.class #=> <TimeLord::Period @beginning=2013-03-03 23:44:59 -0800, @ending=2013-03-04 00:44:59 -0800>
```

Periods, if forced into strings or integers, represent the number of seconds between the two points

``` ruby
1.hour.ago.to_i #=> -3600
```

You can also specify periods from other periods:

``` ruby
1.hour.from(1.day.ago) #=>
1.hour.till(100.years.from_now) #=>
```

Obviously Periods act a lot like a Range and can be coerced into one:

``` ruby
1.hour.ago.to_range #=> 1362383339..1362386939
```

You may have noticed the negative integer from `Period#to_i`.
This represents the period beginning before the ending.
The reverse comes from using `Period#from_now`:

``` ruby
1.hour.from_now.to_i #=> 3600
```

Periods also have a special `Period#to_words` method:

``` ruby
1.hour.ago.to_words #=> "1 hour ago"
200.minutes.ago.to_words #=> "3 hours ago"
```

Of course you can also do fun Time math:

``` ruby
Time.now #=> 2013-03-04 00:55:49 -0800
Time.now - 2.hours #=> 2013-03-03 22:55:50 -0800
```

Time is fun.


Installing
----------

**Requirements**

1. A blue telephone box (optional)

Like any other gem you can install it via the `gem` command:

``` terminal
$ gem install time-lord
```

Although I suggest using `bundler`:

``` ruby
gem 'time-lord', '~> 1.0'
```


**Testing**

To make sure you did everything right, just do the following:

```
$ ruby -e "1.hour.ago.to_words"
> 1 hour ago
```
