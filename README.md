time-lord
=========

**Current Version**: 0.1.5

`time-lord` is a gem that builds on the Time class to give more human expressions.
It adds a lot of nifty little ideas present in Rails helpers to the time class.
Nothing too fancy, just a little human touch to data.


Examples
--------

To use `time-lord` you need a Time, Date, or DateTime object.
You can pass an object that doesn't act like those, but you'll have to tell it to try and parse.
Even then it might not be able to, so be careful and just send Time-likes.
Here's an example or two:

``` ruby
Time.now.ago_in_words
  # => "just now"

olden_times = Time.parse("1942-04-01")

"I was dancing with Queen Elizabeth #{olden_times.ago_in_words} from now!"

# => "I was dancing with Queen Elizabeth 7 decades ago from now!"
```

There's a lot more to come hopefully.
Time is fun.


Installing
----------

**Requirements**

1. Any Ruby with a Time class
2. Any Gem manager
3. A blue telephone box

Like any other gem you can install it via the `gem` command:

``` terminal
$ gem install time-lord
```

Although I suggest using `bundler`:

``` ruby
gem 'time-lord', '0.1.5'
```


**Testing**

To make sure you did everything right, just do the following:

```
$ ruby -e "puts Time.now.ago_in_words"
> just now
```
