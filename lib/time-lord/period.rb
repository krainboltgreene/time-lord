module TimeLord
  # The TimeLord::Period class handles the concept of two points in time and
  # their relation to each other as a range. Conceptually it should duck type
  # the Range class
  #
  # In an effort to keep things clear we codify these terms:
  #
  #   - from/after: beginning is bigger (later) than ending, AKA 5 days
  #     from now is my birthday; AKA 10 seconds after midnight we attack.
  #   - ago/before: beginning is smaller (earlier) than ending, AKA 30 seconds
  #     ago my water broke; AKA for 1 year before last weekend I was a baseball
  #     player
